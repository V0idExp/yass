What is YASS? It's just another 2D space shooter, created for fun.


# Dependencies

The list of dependencies is (hopefully) short and easy to satisfiy:

 * SDL2
 * SDL2_image
 * GLEW

# Build

After having ensured all listed dependencies are installed, just type:

    $ make

# Run

Not that difficult:

    $ ./game
